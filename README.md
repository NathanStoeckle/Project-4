# Project 4

## Description

For my final project, I intend to create two interactive programs and one simple visual, that may turn into an interactive page. The first project may be a single circle that will bounce around in a box, changing its colors, which be automatically done by the program, and speed, which the user will be able to do. The other variation of the first idea is that the ball will go in a circle, but uses the same function of changing colors and speed. Personally, I am going to go with the first variation. The second project will be a color combination creation. This means that when two colors are selected, they will create a color that mixes both into a new color. The third, and final, project idea I have is a starry field that will have different types of colors, which are set, and that they will have a variety of different sizes and shapes, which will primarily use ellipses.

In order to complete all of my ideas, I will be using many resources, such as W3 Schools, the SVG animation, Canvas animation,and interaction tutorials. The type of JavaScript .js programs will most likely vary, but they are mainly SVG.js, Canvas,js, Anime.js, and d3.js.
