                <p>The home page animations use CSS keyframes on load to fade into the page.</p>

                <p>I experimented with this tutorial quite a bit since it used Canvas.js, and to my dismay, it cannot be resized. However, after viewing the file in mobile using the developer tools, the canvas seemed to resize itself just fine. The functions used are to pause and play when the mouse is over the file.</p>

                <h2>Page 2</h2>
                <p>This is based of on a idea of the Ping Pong Tutorial that I done earlier, and I recreated into something that can bounce within the SVG graphic, which used the SVG.js. There was an attempt to be able to pause and played the JavaScript, unfortunately, I could not get it to work.</p>

                </p>
                <p>This idea came after I had decided to scrap the color combination idea. I wanted to create a ripple effect that is mesmerizing, but simple enough to offset the page by not making it center(meaning the rings weren't centered). Just like above(Page 2), there was an attempt to be able t0 pause and play the ripple event, which did not work very will. The JavaScript used the Anime.js.</p>

                <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
                <p>Overall, I feel like that there wasn't much done very well for mean to go and above and beyond, but I feel pretty proud of learning how most the functions, especially since the examples and tutorials didn't explain want each functions and fields did.
